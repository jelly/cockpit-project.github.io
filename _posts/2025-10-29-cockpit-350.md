summary: 'more accurate virtual machine memory usage and podman quadlet lifecycle action support'
---

Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from cockpit-machines 343 and cockpit-podman 116:


## Machines: Memory usage now shows numbers reported by the guest

The memory usage bars now show the same numbers as tools like "top" and "free" when run inside the guest. Specifically, the memory usage shown by Cockpit is based on the "MemAvailable" number of the guest kernel.

To implement this, Cockpit will run `virsh dommemstat <vm name> --period 10 --life`. If that is not acceptable, please let us know.

## Support stopping/starting/restart quadlets

With cockpit-podman now supporting listing inactive quadlets lifecycle operations such as stopping a container are now available and use systemd for these operations instead of podman's API.
