Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 275 and cockpit-podman 53:


## Metrics: Add read/write usage per disk

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17657>
{:.warn}

Adds popover with read/write stats for all disks. Fixes bug where paritions on
NVMe are not skipped which results in incorrect read/write stats.

The button is hidden when only 1 disk is found.

## Shell: Support for alternatives to sudo

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17536>
{:.note}

Cockpit always had the ability to run arbitrary programs to gain administrative access, by adding them to a package manifest.  However, the UI would always use "sudo". Now the UI lets you select which program to use when multiple are defined in the manifests.

By default, Cockpit will still only use "sudo", so unless you actually add more programs via a manifest, there will be no visible change in the UI.


## Image history

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman/pull/1074>
{:.note}

The image detail view now has a new tab which can show the image history similar to `podman image history`.

## Restart policy available for users with lingering enabled

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman/pull/1039>
{:.note}

Although lingering is not recommended, cockpit-podman now supports setting a restart policy when a user has enabled lingering.

## Display ports, volumes and environment variables

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman/pull/1017>
{:.note}

Published ports, mounted volumes and environment variables are now visible in container integration tab.
By default only variables set by user are shown and after clicking `Show more` all variables are visible.
